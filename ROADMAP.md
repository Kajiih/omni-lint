# Omni Toolkit Roadmap

This document serves as the single source of truth for architectural milestones, performance optimizations, and planned ecosystem integrations for Omni.

---

## 1. Rule Engine & Declarative Rules

- **Dynamic Selector Deserialization**:
  - *Current*: `Selector` deserialization directly scans static `CODE_RULES` and `COMMAND_RULES` registries.
  - *Target*: Decouple selector resolution from static arrays to allow dynamically registered and external declarative rules loaded from configuration files (`.omnilint.toml`).
- **Rule Naming Canonicalization (`heck`)**:
  - *Target*: Support case-insensitive and format-tolerant rule selection (matching `SingleLetterVariableName`, `single-letter-variable-name`, and `single_letter_variable_name` interchangeably).
  - *Trigger*: When adding declarative AST rule files or multi-rule alias configurations.
- **Rule Autofix Engine (`diffy` / `similar`)**:
  - *Target*: Extend `CodeRule` and `CommandRule` with optional auto-fix transformations. Support `--fix` and `--fix --dry-run` with in-memory unified diff previews before writing changes to disk.
  - *Trigger*: When implementing the first batch of auto-fixable rules (e.g., replacing `logging.error` with `logging.exception`).

## 2. Performance & VCS Optimizations

- **Subprocess Batching & Caching (`EnvContext`)**:
  - *Current*: Command rules spawn individual `jj` or `git` CLI calls per evaluation.
  - *Target*: Introduce a shared `EnvContext` struct that pre-fetches and caches repository state (e.g., batching queries into a single `jj log --json` or `git status` invocation) to ensure sub-10ms execution across multiple rules.
- **VCS Error Propagation**:
  - *Current*: VCS client query errors in command rules are swallowed to avoid blocking users on query failures.
  - *Target*: Propagate structured errors or display user warnings when the underlying VCS client fails unexpectedly, distinguishing clean working copies from failed CLI calls.

---

## 3. Reporting & Diagnostics

- **Feature-Gated Rich Terminal Diagnostics (`miette`)**:
  - *Current*: Fast, zero-dependency printer in `src/diagnostic.rs` outputting standard compiler-style format (`path:line:col: [CODE] message`) and JSON.
  - *Target*: Add an optional Cargo feature (`features = ["miette"]`) that enables rich, syntax-highlighted source snippets with colored squiggly underlines and clickable rule documentation URLs, while keeping the default pre-commit hook binary lightweight and fast.
- **Polished Diagnostic Summaries (`pluralizer` / Native Helper)**:
  - *Target*: Clean grammatical inflection ("1 violation" vs "3 violations") in terminal summary footers, JSON reports, and future JUnit/SARIF export formats.

---

## 4. Testing & Verification

- **Automated Rule Test Verification**:
  - *Current*: Tests are validated via runtime registry loops.
  - *Target*: Compile-time or CI assertion ensuring that colocated test suites exist for every registered rule, preventing rules from being added without corresponding snapshot and unit test coverage.
