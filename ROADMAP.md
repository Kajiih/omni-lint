# Omni Toolkit Roadmap

This document serves as the single source of truth for architectural milestones, performance investigations, and planned ecosystem integrations for Omni.

Items here represent design areas and technical directions to evaluate rather than fixed implementation mandates.

---

## Random
- Review the names of the rules, of the configuration, etc, to make them totally aligned on what the are, explicit and self explanatory, and coherent together.
- Also review the violation message, so they correctly explain what is the issue and why it is one rather than just explaining what the code does, and that the suggestion correctly point to correct solutions, so the user (or agent) can fix it autonomously. They should push to a single direction, which is the pit of success, even if it seems pedantic. Use `ruff` documentation as a reference and improve on it.
  - Write a **Violation Message Style Guide** and review all violation messages (`summary`, `rationale`, `suggestion`) so they concisely state the issue (`summary`), explain why it is harmful rather than just restating what the code does (`rationale`), and point to a single canonical "pit of success" solution so a user or agent can fix it autonomously (`suggestion`). Use `ruff` documentation as a reference and improve on it.
  - Reviewed violation message that we can use as reference

## Architecture & Conformance

Design: `decisions/006_architectural_dag_and_conformance.md`. Enforcement: `src/architecture.rs` (graph definition) and `tests/architecture_conformance.rs` (source-tree conformance).

- Review our architecure, component, abstraction, modules, etc names as well to align and have the explicit and self explanatory.
- **Conformance CST Edge Cases (Watch List)**:
  - *Current*: `summarize_rust_file` skips `macro_definition` bodies (production macros `architecture_component!` and `rule_test!` expand either to a doc attribute or inside `#[cfg(test)]`) and assumes paths do not start with a root-anchored leading `::` (`::omni::...` or `::ast_grep_core::...`).
  - *Target*: If production `macro_rules!` macros calling cross-component helpers (`$crate::...`) are introduced outside `src/lib.rs`, or if root-anchored `::` paths appear, extend `summarize_rust_file` to scan `macro_rule` body token trees and normalize leading `::` prefixes.
- **Non-transitive DAG edges**: every edge is transitive today, so a component reaches everything its dependencies reach. A "private" edge (a dependency that dependents do not inherit) would let the graph express isolation rules that currently need bespoke conformance checks.
- **Compiler-enforced subtree visibility (`pub(in crate::...)` / `pub(super)`)**: tighten item visibility to `pub(in crate::code_lint)`, `pub(in crate::command_lint)`, or `pub(super)` wherever component boundaries align with a directory subtree, so cross-domain access fails in `rustc` (`E0603`) before conformance tests run.
- **Standalone crate extraction**: once the DAG design items above settle (or when a second project needs it), evaluate extracting the declarative architecture and conformance engine into a standalone publishable crate (zero-dependency `define_architecture!` / `architecture_component!` macros in `[dependencies]`, CST conformance runner behind a `check` feature in `[dev-dependencies]`), moving `summarize_rust_file` out of `src/code_lint/ast/rust.rs`.

## Rule Engine & Declarative Rules

- **Unified Single-Pass AST Visitor Dispatch**:
  - *Context & Problem*: Today, each registered rule implements `check_file` independently and executes its own AST search or traversal over the file. At 16 rules on ~8k lines, rule passes take ~180ms total (~11ms/rule). However, this scales linearly as $O(\text{files} \times \text{rules})$: at 100+ rules, traversing the syntax tree 100 times per file becomes a multi-second bottleneck.
  - *Investigation & Design Questions*:
    - Investigate how high-throughput linters dispatch rules. (e.g. Ruff's `Checker` uses a single AST walk with match arms and $O(1)$ bitset checks; Biome groups subscriptions by `SyntaxKind`; Clippy fuses passes into combined callbacks).
    - Can we establish a rule interest declaration (e.g. target node kinds) early in the trait lifecycle without breaking existing rule independence?
    - How do we handle rules that need multi-stage context (like `environment_variable_in_function` traversing upward or `too_many_assertions` counting inner blocks) within a unified traversal?
  - *Trigger*: When the code rule registry approaches ~30–40 rules, or when rule evaluation time exceeds parse time.
- **Rule Naming Canonicalization (`heck`)**:
  - *Target*: Support case-insensitive and format-tolerant rule selection (matching `SingleLetterName`, `single-letter-name`, and `single_letter_name` interchangeably).
  - *Trigger*: When adding declarative AST rule files or multi-rule alias configurations.
- **Rule Autofix Engine (`diffy` / `similar`)**:
  - *Target*: Extend `CodeRule` and `CommandRule` with optional auto-fix transformations. Support `--fix` and `--fix --dry-run` with in-memory unified diff previews before writing changes to disk.
  - *Trigger*: When implementing the first batch of auto-fixable rules (e.g., replacing `logging.error` with `logging.exception`).
- **Multiline Decorator & Attribute Span Awareness for `omni:ignore`**:
  - *Current*: `compute_effective_target_line` in `src/code_lint/suppression.rs` advances `end_target_line` across contiguous lines starting with `@`, `#[`, `//`, or `#`, handling single-line decorators and attributes. However, multiline decorators or attributes whose continuation lines do not start with `@` or `#[` stop the line scan early.
  - *Target*: Use AST decorated/attributed node spans in the suppression resolver so `omni:ignore` placed above a multiline decorator/attribute block suppresses diagnostics on the underlying declaration.
- **Generic Container Base-Type Matching (`identical-positional-types`)**:
  - *Current*: Positional parameter types are compared by exact formatted annotation string (`dict[str, int]` != `dict[str, float]`).
  - *Target*: Optionally normalize or group generic collection/mapping containers (`dict[...]`, `Mapping[...]`, `list[...]`, `Sequence[...]`) so multiple positional mappings or sequences are flagged even when their inner type arguments differ.
- **Escaping Nested Scopes (`environment-variable-in-function`)**:
  - *Current*: The boundary exemption (`main`, `from_env`, ...) is inherited by every scope declared inside it, which is correct for nested functions and closures but also exempts a class declared inside a boundary whose methods later escape (returned, registered as a callback).
  - *Target*: Treat a `class` / `impl` declared inside a boundary as a barrier that resets the exemption, once a real-world occurrence justifies the added language-specific complexity.
- **Import-Aware Qualified Call Resolution (`src/code_lint/semantic/calls.rs`)**:
  - *Current*: Banned calls are matched syntactically by call-site name (like `ast-grep` and Polybot), as documented in each rule's `what_it_does`. A bare call imported from an unrelated library (`from sqlalchemy import cast`, `from httpx import patch`) is flagged, while an aliased module call (`import typing as t; t.cast(...)`) is missed.
  - *Target*: Evaluate adding a per-file scope and import symbol table (modeled on Ruff's `SemanticModel::resolve_qualified_name`) that resolves imported and aliased callees to their canonical qualified path while distinguishing module imports from local parameter/fixture receivers (`mocker.patch`, `monkeypatch.setattr`, `loop.create_task`).

## Candidate Rules

Source: Python Tip of the Week #069 "Prefer constants over wild values" (go/python-tips/069) and Polybot `IndexingInsteadOfUnpackingRule` (`scratch/polybot_reference/check_custom_lints.py`). Candidates to prioritize, not commitments.

- **`repeated-index-access`** (Python, Rust — tip `#unpack`) — **implemented**, design in `docs/dev/prefer_tuple_unpacking/`. Follow-ups:
  - *Named record for sparse positional access*: reads needing more `_` placeholders than `repeated-index-access` allows (`row[0]`, `row[7]`) → `NamedTuple` / dataclass / struct (or `csv.DictReader` for CSV rows).
  - *Tuple-returning functions*: functions returning tuples of ≥3 elements → `NamedTuple` / dataclass / struct.
  - *Multi-field tuple structs* (Rust): tuple structs with ≥2 fields → named-field struct (tuple structs reserved for newtypes).
  - *`re.Match` group indexing* (Python): `m[1]`, `m[2]` → `a, b = m.groups()`.
  - *Rust slice patterns*: `arr[0]`, `arr[1]` on fixed-size arrays → `let [a, b] = arr;`.
  - *Macro arguments*: reads inside expression-like macros (`format!`, `assert_eq!`, `vec![]`) are not inspected because tree-sitter leaves them as flat `token_tree` tokens (pass case `known_gap_macro_arguments_not_inspected`). Supporting them needs a multi-token span in `AstNode` (`cmd.span.0` is several tokens, not one node) or re-parsing the arguments as expressions.
  - *Receiver rebinding*: `a = p[0]; p = nxt(); b = p[1]` groups two different values as one receiver (both languages). Needs binding awareness (split the group at each rebinding).
  - *Shadowing*: a closure parameter (`|t| t.1`) or comprehension variable reusing the receiver's name is grouped with the outer receiver (both languages).
  - *Receiver normalization*: receivers are grouped by source text, so `(t).0` vs `t.0`, `len((xs))` vs `len(xs)`, and chains split across lines are not recognized as the same receiver.
- **`no-manual-enum-name-map`** (Python, Rust — tip `#protobufs`):
  - *Detection*: A dict literal where every entry is `'NAME': X.Y.NAME` (string key equals the value's last attribute). Suggest `Enum.Value(name)` (protobuf), `Enum[name]`, or `Enum.__members__`.
  - *Rust*: `match` arms mapping `"Alpha" => Kind::Alpha` → derive `strum::EnumString`.
- **`no-overprecise-float-in-tests`** (Python, Rust — tip `#keep_it_simple`):
  - *Detection*: Float literals in test code with more significant digits than a configurable threshold (e.g. >6).
  - *Overlap*: Clippy `excessive_precision` only flags digits beyond `f64` representability, not unreadable test values.
- **`no-repeated-literals`** (Python, Rust — tip core rule and `#no_magic`):
  - *Detection*: The same string or numeric literal appearing ≥N times in one file. Exempt `0`, `1`, `-1`, `''`, very short strings, docstrings, and annotations (the tip's own `_ZERO` / `_COMMA` / `TWO` counter-examples). Minimum count and string length via `LanguageDefaults` thresholds.
  - *Blocker*: Per-file aggregation cannot satisfy `rule_test!`'s repeated-occurrence check (`assert_every_occurrence_reported` expects exactly two diagnostics at mirrored spans). Requires a per-file opt-out in the harness first (see `docs/dev/rule_design_guide.md` §6). Guardrail: make it a per-case opt-out, and have `tests/registry.rs` require at least one fully checked `fail` case per language, so the opt-out cannot hide a rule that stops after its first match.
- **Time-unit literal arithmetic** (extension of `primitive-duration` — tip `#rationale`):
  - *Detection*: `24 * 60 * 60`, `60 * 60`, `86400`, `3600` → `timedelta` / `Duration`.
- **Import alias conventions** (`import x as y`, `use x as y`):
  - *Context*: Naming rules (`single-letter-name`, `abbreviated-name`, `type-suffixed-name`, `primitive-duration`) skip all imports, including aliased imports.
  - *Investigation*: Evaluate how much is already covered by Ruff's `flake8-import-conventions` (`ICN001` `unconventional-import-alias`, `ICN002` `banned-import-alias`) and Pylint (`PLC0414` `useless-import-alias`), and whether a dedicated multi-language import-alias rule is warranted in Omni.
- *Not pursued*: magic numbers in comparisons (covered by Ruff `PLR2004`), bare HTTP status codes (too narrow), path composition (Ruff `PTH`), test correspondence-signaling and same-value/different-meaning constants (require semantic understanding).

## 2. Performance & Concurrency Architecture

- **Directory Discovery Parallelism & Micro-Run Overhead**:
  - *Current*: File-level analysis runs in parallel via `rayon` (`targets.into_par_iter()`) with deterministic sorting across both plain-text and JSON output, while directory traversal in `collect_directory_candidates` runs single-threaded via `ignore::WalkBuilder::build()`.
  - *Investigation*:
    - Evaluate whether `ignore::WalkParallel` improves directory discovery on large repositories compared to single-threaded collection + `rayon`.
    - Measure `rayon` thread-pool initialization overhead on small repositories to ensure micro-runs and pre-commit hooks are not penalized.
- **Parse & Pipeline Floor Profiling**:
  - *Context*: Disabling all rules via tag exclusion shows that the shared per-file pipeline (walking files, reading from disk, tree-sitter parsing via `ast-grep`, and comment suppression scanning) accounts for ~228ms (56% of total runtime on ~8k lines). Pre-I/O `detect_language` filtering is in place, and `SuppressionTracker::from_file` skips the comment walk on files without `omni:`.
  - *Investigation*: Break down the remaining cost between Tree-sitter parser initialization and tree building, and whether either can be reduced.
- **Subprocess Batching & Caching (`EnvContext`)**:
  - *Current*: Command rules spawn individual `jj` or `git` CLI calls per evaluation.
  - *Target*: Introduce a shared `EnvContext` struct that pre-fetches and caches repository state (e.g., batching queries into a single `jj log --json` or `git status` invocation) to ensure sub-10ms execution across multiple rules.
- **VCS Error Propagation**:
  - *Current*: VCS client query errors in command rules are swallowed to avoid blocking users on query failures.
  - *Target*: Propagate structured errors or display user warnings when the underlying VCS client fails unexpectedly, distinguishing clean working copies from failed CLI calls.

## 3. Performance Measurement, Tracing & Tooling

- **Execution Timing & Observability (`--timings`)**:
  - *Context*: Understanding which rules or pipeline stages dominate execution on a user's machine is essential for performance triage.
  - *Investigation & Design Questions*:
    - Compare a lightweight, zero-dependency `--timings` flag (using `std::time::Instant` around rule executions to produce a sorted table, following oxlint's `--debug timings` or ESLint's `TIMING=1`) against heavyweight runtime tracing.
    - SOTA review shows that full `tracing-subscriber` pipelines pull in substantial dependencies (`sharded-slab`, `regex-automata`, etc.) and are best suited for server/LSP contexts rather than fast batch CLI invocations.
    - Explore what level of timing granularity is useful (per-rule vs. pipeline phase) without penalizing normal runs.
- **Benchmarking & Regression Guard Strategy**:
  - *Context*: Simple shell-level timing (`date +%s%N`) exhibits $\pm 17\%$ noise on sub-second runs, causing false regressions. At the same time, threshold-based wall-clock assertions on shared CI runners (e.g. GitHub Actions) suffer from high variance (15–30%) and lead to flaky CI.
  - *Investigation & Design Questions*:
    - Evaluate local developer micro-benchmarking harnesses: `divan` (lightweight, zero additional heavy dependencies) vs. `criterion` (industry standard, but heavier dependency footprint).
    - Explore CI regression gating models: evaluate simulated instruction-count tracking (e.g., CodSpeed or Valgrind cachegrind) vs. keeping performance gates advisory/local to prevent CI alert fatigue.
    - Define a standardized macro-benchmark corpus (e.g., fixed snapshot of source files) executed via `hyperfine` for reproducible end-to-end timing.
- **Profiling Workflow & Cargo Configuration**:
  - *Target*: Document standard profiling recipes for Linux (`samply`, `perf`) and macOS (`cargo-instruments`). Establish a dedicated `[profile.profiling]` Cargo profile (`inherits = "release"`, `debug = "line-tables-only"`, `strip = "none"`) that provides symbolicated stack traces without bloating production binaries.

---

## 4. Reporting & Diagnostics

- **Feature-Gated Rich Terminal Diagnostics (`miette`)**:
  - *Current*: Fast, zero-dependency printer in `src/diagnostic.rs` outputting standard compiler-style format (`path:line:col: [CODE] message`) and JSON.
  - *Target*: Add an optional Cargo feature (`features = ["miette"]`) that enables rich, syntax-highlighted source snippets with colored squiggly underlines and clickable rule documentation URLs, while keeping the default pre-commit hook binary lightweight and fast.
- **Polished Diagnostic Summaries (`pluralizer` / Native Helper)**:
  - *Target*: Clean grammatical inflection ("1 violation" vs "3 violations") in terminal summary footers, JSON reports, and future JUnit/SARIF export formats.

---

## 5. Tags, Discovery & Documentation

Design rationale: [ADR 007](decisions/007_rule_taxonomy_and_selection.md) (taxonomy and selection) and [ADR 008](decisions/008_rule_documentation_and_discovery.md) (rule docs and discovery). Contributor guide: [docs/dev/tag_guide.md](docs/dev/tag_guide.md).

- **Shadowed-selector config warning**: warn when a `select` or `ignore` entry changes no rule's outcome (needs config warning plumbing).
- **Colocate contributor guides (`docs/dev/rule_design_guide.md`, `docs/dev/tag_guide.md`) into Rustdoc (`//!` and `///`)**:
  - *Investigation*: Evaluate moving `rule_design_guide.md` (and the classification rules of `tag_guide.md`) directly into module and item doc comments on `src/rule_declaration.rs`, `ViolationTemplate` (`src/diagnostic.rs`), and `rule_test!` (`src/test_utils.rs`). This replaces placeholder `missing_docs` one-liners with the real specification, eliminates the duplicate component table in `rule_design_guide.md` §7, surfaces the guide in IDE hover, and enforces symbol references via `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`.
- **Rule Doc Examples**:
  - *Current*: Every code rule's `rule_test!` pass/fail cases are the best-maintained examples, but they live in `#[cfg(test)]` and no doc can use them. Command rules and suppression audits have no `rule_test!`.
  - *Target*: Add Example / Use-instead sections sourced from a marked subset of test cases per language, so rendered examples are always executed as tests.
- **Discovery & Documentation Follow-ups**:
  - JSON output for discovery commands (`--format json` for `--list-rules` / `--explain`), and `tags` on JSON diagnostics. Include per-language message overrides (`summary` / `rationale` / `suggestion`), not just the base text.
  - Path-aware status in `explain` (evaluating `per-file-ignores` for a given file path).
  - Ready-to-paste `[rules.<name>]` TOML block in `--explain` (in addition to the current bullet list rendered from `DeclaredOptions`), guarded by a round-trip test that parses the rendered TOML back into `Config` and compares effective values per language.
  - Generated in-repo rule catalog guarded by a golden-file drift test.
  - Styled Markdown rendering in the terminal.
  - JSON Schema for `.omnilint.toml` (editor completion). It must be registry-aware, because `rules` is a free map: per-rule keys and defaults, the threshold bounds each rule uses, language sub-tables, and every rule name and tag as a selector value. Document the `#:schema` directive (Taplo) in the README.
  - Typed overlap / sources field linking rules to equivalent Ruff / Clippy rules.
  - Decide whether plain diagnostics keep printing the full rationale and suggestion on every hit.
  - Investigate subcommands (`rules`, `explain`, a default `check`) instead of the `--list-rules` / `--explain` flags.
- **Later / Out-of-Scope Ideas**:
  - **Abstraction-driven auto-tagging**: importing or using a domain helper (e.g. a logging abstraction) automatically attaches its topic tag to the rule.
  - **Computed `recommended` view**: if curated presets are ever introduced, define `recommended` as a computed view (`exact` ∧ `unopinionated`) rather than a second hand-maintained list.
