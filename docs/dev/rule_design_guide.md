# Rule Design Guide & Best Practices

This guide outlines principles for designing high-signal, actionable lint rules in Omni. It focuses on the design philosophy of rules—not engine implementation details.

---

## 1. Rule Granularity: 1 Rule = 1 Antipattern
A lint rule is not a broad category (e.g. avoid rules like `async-hygiene` or `test-cleanliness`). A rule must target **one specific antipattern**.

* **Why Granularity Matters**: Configuration, CI blocking, and suppressions operate at the rule level. If two distinct antipatterns share a rule name, teams cannot suppress or configure one without affecting the other.
* **The Split Test**: If two violations differ in **why** they are bad or **how** to fix them, they are separate rules.
  * *Example*: Wall-clock `sleep(5)` causes flaky tests and slow CI (`no-sleep-in-tests`). Zero-duration `sleep(0)` is an attempt to yield to the scheduler (`no-zero-sleep-in-tests`). Different rationales and remedies mean different rules.
* **When to Parameterize**: If the concept, rationale, and fix are identical across syntax variations (e.g., compound boolean assertions vs. tuple equality packing), keep them under one rule and parameterize the message.

## 2. Actionability: Why & How, Not Just What
A diagnostic that only says "X is banned" causes frustration. Developers need to understand the harm and the idiomatic path forward.

Every rule diagnostic must answer three questions:
1. **What**: The specific construct flagged in the user's code.
2. **Why (Rationale)**: The tangible harm (flakiness, hidden exceptions, cognitive overhead, data races). Never cite "team convention" or "linter policy" as the rationale.
3. **How (Suggestion)**: The idiomatic alternative. Always provide a constructive replacement pattern (e.g., replace `logging.error` with `logging.exception`; replace `sleep` with deterministic event synchronization).

## 3. Anticipate Perverse Incentives
Developers under pressure will take the path of least resistance to satisfy a linter. A poorly designed rule often incentivizes worse code.

* **Assertion Limits**: Limiting assertions per test can tempt developers to pack multiple conditions into boolean tuples (`assert (a, b) == (1, 2)`) or wrap assertions in obscure closures solely to bypass the count. Anticipate this by pairing limits with rules against assertion packing, and encourage domain assertions or snapshot testing instead.
* **Blanket Avoidance**: Make sure rules encourage the correct abstraction, not superficial workarounds that defeat static analysis.

---

## 4. Universal Concepts, Idiomatic Guidance
The architectural antipattern is usually language-agnostic; the solution is almost always language-specific.

* **Unify the concept**: Antipatterns like unstructured concurrency, arbitrary test delays, or Hungarian notation exist across languages.
* **Specialize the guidance**: Tailor suggestions to native idioms and libraries (e.g., recommend `@pytest.mark.parametrize` in Python vs. `#[rstest]` in Rust). Avoid generic advice when language-standard tools exist.

---

## 5. Extensibility Over Dogma
Static rules should establish sane defaults while respecting domain vocabulary.

* **Allowlists & Denylists**: Name-checking rules (abbreviations, type suffixes) must support extension and exemption. Certain terms may be primitive keywords in one language or valid domain acronyms in a specific codebase (e.g., `str` is a primitive in Rust, not an abbreviation).
* **Thresholds**: Numeric bounds (e.g., maximum assertions per test) must be configurable so teams can adjust the strictness without disabling the rule entirely.
